<h3>Business Problem</h3>
<p>
The client is an Android developer who wants to build an app to launch it in the Google Play store. 
He has approached us to analyze the Play Store and provide suggestions on what kind of app to build to get the most downloads, revenue, and ratings possible.
The Key Business Requirements are:
<ol>
   <li> Identify the different types of content available on the platform. 
   </li>
   <li>Study the popularity of different types of content around the world.
   </li>
  <li>Analyze the trend over the years.
   </li>
  <li>Develop some strategies based on the above analysis.
   </li>
  <li>Build a dashboard to present the findings.

<h3>Tools Used</h3>

  <li>
   Excel: Data Loading, Data cleaning, Data Analysis, Data visualization
  </li>
 </ol>
 

<h3>Key Insights</h3>
<ol>
 <li>People always prefer free apps but we can see a significant no. of downloads for paid apps as well. So, the client can go for a paid app that can be a good source of revenue.
</li>
 <li>In the PAID APP categories, the ‘FAMILY’ category can make the highest revenues with an average revenue of 450 million.</li>
 <li>So, the client can compromise on the revenues and build an app in the GAMES category, to achieve a good average rating of 4.28.</li>
 <li>The chart depicting the average size of the apps can help the client find the maximum limit for the size of the app to attract more customers.</li>
</ol>
