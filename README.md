<ol>
<li>🎥: Over the last decade, the platform has seen a tremendous increase in the quantity of content added to the platform most of which belongs to the Movie category. 86% content is of movie type. However, People prefer Shows over movies so the focus can be shifted towards adding more shows and creating movies only in the most popular and highly rated genres.</li>
<li>🎭: A huge amount of content created by the platform belongs to a single genre ‘drama’ while people are appreciating content that has a mixture of several genres. So, the creative teams can focus on building content involving different genres and emotions to create engaging content.</li>
<li>🌎: The USA and INDIA are the two biggest production countries producing more than 60% of the content. The aim should be to utilize their resources and the competencies of some other highly rated production countries such as Japan to build quality content.</li>
<li>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦: The platform is creating TV-G content prominently but the analysis reveals that people are watching PG-13 and TV-MA predominantly. So, the content can be curated accordingly to increase the viewership.</li>
