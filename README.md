<h3>Business Problem</h3>
<p>
Assume you work in the data analytics team of Amazon Prime. The business management head has approached the team. He/She wants to present the business overview to the executives and investors; for this, he/she seeks the help of data analytics.

</p>

<h3>Tools Used</h3>

  </li>
 </ol>
 

<h3>Key Insights</h3>
<ol>
 <li>People always prefer free apps but we can see a significant no. of downloads for paid apps as well. So, the client can go for a paid app that can be a good source of revenue.
</li>
 <li>In the PAID APP categories, the ‘FAMILY’ category can make the highest revenues with an average revenue of 450 million.</li>
 <li>So, the client can compromise on the revenues and build an app in the GAMES category, to achieve a good average rating of 4.28.</li>
 <li>The chart depicting the average size of the apps can help the client find the maximum limit for the size of the app to attract more customers.</li>
</ol>
